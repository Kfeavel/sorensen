# Sorensen Compression
The world's most space efficient compression algorithm!

With Sorensen Compression, all files, no matter the size, can be compressed to only **24 bytes**.
You read that right. Only **24 bytes** to compress any file! By recording minimal information about the
original file, Sorensen Compression is able to save you precious storage space.

## How it works

What is a file? Nothing more than a pile of bits. By recording how many bits the original file contained
(the file size, `N`), how many of those bits were set to `1`, and a hash, we're able to recreate any file of any
size using only this information by walking every permutation of `1`s and `0`s for `N` bits.

## Tradeoffs

Everyone knows that space is far more precious than time. The universe has about 1.7 Ã— 10<sup>106</sup> years left.
As such, it seems like a fair tradeoff that all of the space and information saved during compression is offset by
how much time it takes to decompress a zipped file.

If a more precise measure of how long Sorensen Compression takes is desired, the Big-O notation for the decompression
algorithm is \
**O( (2n)! / (n!)^2 )**.

## Limitations

The biggest limitation is that most people don't live past the age of 90 years. So, don't compress anything larger than
17 bits and it'll be done within the next 74 years. Compress 18 bits and it'll take about 287 years. So maybe the decompression
will be done in time for your great, great, grandchildren to appreciate the contents of the original file by the time they're 70. :)

## How can I help?

You can't. Nothing short of a miracle will save this algorithm. Unless you're capable of doing literal digital magic
or some sort of incantation, there's not much that will save this program from being awful.

This code is so bad that has been made illegal in at least 13 countries and banned from discussion within the scientific community.
